                color scheme, which features shades of white, gray and blue.</p>
            <p>Overall, these designs choices contribute to an appealing user experience. The code for HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript is structured and modular, with maintainability in mind. This makes it simple to update and
                change the auto-changing background feature without affecting the functionality or user experience of
